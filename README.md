The frontend of my Portfolio site is designed to showcase my capabilities with React, but also host and easy to navigate directory of my projects. The frameworks used were React and Bootstrap to allow for easy responsive design.

To create my portfolio app, I've compiled skills I have learned from a variety of different sources which I have accumulated over the years. I wanted a fun project to work on, while showcasing my skills in both backend and frontend development. The project even forced me to learn new technologies, which I've outlined below.

</p>

After working with [Ruru Software](https://github.com/ruru-software) on a Project on AWS, I decided to expand my knowledge of Lambda and Dynamo DB while working on this project. I thought of some fun operations to use to allow users to sign up and request certain permissions on the site. So far it has given me a much deeper understanding of AWS and it's offering.

### Motivation & what was learned

The motivation was simple, I wanted somewhere (other than GitHub of course) to showcase my projects. For this project, I decided to fully commit to a TypeScript as my language of choice going forward. It's been a challenge to say the least, but I feel I have learned so much about TypeScript and really started to understand the benefits of using it for development. Admittedly, after completing Maximilian Schwarzmüller's [Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) course I did not fully grasp the benefits of the language, it seemed to add more roadblocks over solutions. However, after speaking to many friends about my feelings the assured it would help with streamlining development. After committing to this project, I finally understand what the mean!

Along with Typescript, I learned React-Bootstrap for the first time which was a huge help. I was not looking forward to toiling away with various browser elements. It was a happy accident I discovered this when I did, it's made developing the front end a lot more enjoyable.

</p>

Finally, I learned a little about CSS animations and the use of SVG's. I wanted my homepage to pop, so I incorporated an infinite loop on the laptop screen you can see above. You can see a small sample (in GIF format) of the animation in action above.
