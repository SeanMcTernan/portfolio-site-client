The backend of the Portfolio site is designed to showcase my capabilities with React, but also host and easy to navigate directory of my projects. The frameworks used were React and Bootstrap to allow for easy responsive design.

To create my portfolio app, I've compiled skills I have learned from a variety of different sources which I have accumulated over the years. I wanted a fun project to work on, while showcasing my skills in both backend and frontend development. The project even forced me to learn new technologies, which I've outlined below.

After working with [Ruru Software](https://github.com/ruru-software) on a Project on AWS, I decided to expand my knowledge of Lambda and Dynamo DB while working on this project. I thought of some fun operations to use to allow users to sign up and request certain permissions on the site. So far it has given me a much deeper understanding of AWS and it's offering.
