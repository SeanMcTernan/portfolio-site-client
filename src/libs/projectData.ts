    appDescription: 'RiverText is a system that allows users to receive river flow information from The Canadian Water Office by sending a message from a satellite phone or any SMS enabled device. By sending a message to a Toll Free number, the app takes the request and queries the corresponding river name for its recent flow information and sends it back to the user. At this time there is no Frontend for the app, however it is operational. You can text any of the rivers in the rivers array to 833-589-0354 and receive a message. For example, text Stikine to 833-589-0354 and ask for the level of the Stikine River in Northern BC.',
    description: 'In 2019, I was fortunate enough to successfully kayak down one of the most challenging stretches of whitewater on the planet in Northern BC. The Grand Canyon of the Stikine. Traditionally, the run takes 3 days, so within those 3 days much can change as far as the river level is concerned. Each evening I sent a message via satellite phone to a friend to ask what the current level on the river was, I would have to wait for him to check his phone, then the government website for an accurate flow reading, then reply. It was quite cumbersome. From this, the idea for this app was created. An app that would sit and listen for inbound requests for river levels on a given set of rivers and reply with the latest reading. To set myself an additional challenge I decided to write this app in TypeScript. I had not yet built a live app via Typescript, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to apply what I had learned in some courses I was taking. The app as it stands is in its raw form. Going forward I would like to have a front end to show a map of rivers that are available and add a host server for remote to send flow data from gauge projects we are also working on. ',

I really felt there was a better more efficient way to close out these conversations and this is where the app was born. Along the way I learned some neat technologies like Inquirer and Chalk, though the biggest takeaway was finally getting a solid grasp of asynchronous functions. The app needed to call the intercom API continuously while it was running, so getting comfortable with asynchronous functions was vital to the successful rollout of the app.',

    description: 'The motivation was simple, I wanted somewhere (other than GitHub of course) to showcase my projects. For this project, I decided to fully commit to a TypeScript as my language of choice going forward. Its been a challenge to say the least, but I feel I have learned so much about TypeScript and really started to understand the benefits of using it for development. Admittedly, after completing Maximilian SchwarzmuÌˆller`s Understanding TypeScript course I did not fully grasp the benefits of the language, it seemed to add more roadblocks over solutions. However, after speaking to many friends about my feelings the assured it would help with streamlining development. After committing to this project, I finally understand what the mean! Along with Typescript, I learned React-Bootstrap for the first time which was a huge help. I was not looking forward to toiling away with various browser elements. It was a happy accident I discovered this when I did, it`s made developing the front end a lot more enjoyable.',

Needless to say, a note taking app is about as original as printing hello world!, but in this instance a familiar application made it easier to digest the new methods that were being applied. AWS Cognito, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB were all used, so it was a deep dive into new concepts. Likewise, it was very interesting to see committed changes being sent automatically to Netlify, a concept I was familiar with, but had yet to see it in practice.',
