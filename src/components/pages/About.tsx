            What started out as a necessity to learn to code, quickly grew into
            a passion of mine that I have dedicated years learning to craft.
            Coding is now the furthest thing from 'just a job' for me. It's an
            outlet to engage in challenging tasks, while feeling rewarded by the
            elegant solutions that are created along the way. Software
            development is 'The Never Ending Story', as the industry grows and
            adapts, I too must adapt with it. <br></br>
            <br></br>Outside of my professional experience I engage in projects
            that challenge me, yet serve a personal purpose, this not only helps
            me professionaly, but also scratches the itch I have for challenges
            and creative solutions. When you get to know me, you will know I am
            not one to just sit around!

                was strictly a mobile application for users to explore 3D maps
                offline for outdoor regions. CEO and founder Frazer Hogg
                contracted me to create a backend for administrators of the app
                to upload map data onto the DynamoDB on AWS. Once completed, the
                next phase will involve building a front end with React for the
                administrators to login and edit the map information.

                Daily tasks include querying our Mongo DB Database and logs for
                unknown issues. Scripting reports and fixes within the database
                using Node.js and MongoDB. As an after hours project, wrote an

                Developed an online supply store for our clients across Canada
                and Europe using AWS. Using DynamoDB and Lambda I developed a
                supply store which serviced some of the largest companies in Oil
                & Gas in North America. Users and their roles were managed using
                MongoDB. The Frontend was developed using React and React Redux.
                I also developed a back end to fulfill print orders with third
                part vendors and a payment processing using Stripe.

                Printlogix had a low number of staff compared to its user base
                of 20,000+. The result being, many hats were worn. Therefore,
                along with development, database administration and testing I
                oversaw front end design and implementing integration with third
                party API's such as Zendesk and Olark. Finally, I took ownership
                of the Agile process. I worked directly with the CEO to
                communicate product direction to the rest of the development
                team.
